	<h3>AI stuff </h3>
	<p>This page catalogs some experiments with AI in preparation for teaching classes. My intent is to explore this with students to see what we can develop from it.</p>

	<p>Probably my favorite work so far is with my own images using a GAN to create virtually unlimited variants. I can see theat the more specific the images I put in, the more realistic the output, here is a blog that talks about the work: <a href="https://rubaiyat.wordpress.com/2022/07/29/working-with-gans-and-images-v-1/">https://rubaiyat.wordpress.com/2022/07/29/working-with-gans-and-images-v-1/</a></p>

  <p>I've been into horror for a while and though I have some misgivings about HPL as a person, I still find the cosmic horror compelling. Working with the text I've used GPT2 and created a text generator which you can use if you like, but you'll have to pay to run it (after the free trial period, of course). <a href="https://rubaiyat.wordpress.com/2022/08/01/not-lovecraft/">https://rubaiyat.wordpress.com/2022/08/01/not-lovecraft/</a></p>
  <p>Below are a bunch of experiments that I did with Style GAN, I really liked the way the Picasso style impacted images and movies, and was particularly drawn into the way that it worked with glitches.</p>
