Oh man, my computer dumped me after I'd done some editing...Today is
February 7, I hope I can recapitulate what I'd done...I don't have
it exactly written down...

What?! do you think that nothing will change?!
Must it be? all things must stay the same?!

No! I say, No, No and No again
Tho I'm not suggesting complete mayhem.

Let Go!  Be Free!  (But not insane)
The Laws of Physics must be rearranged.

Now-
Long ago all was so nice
Straight lines, flat planes seemed to suffice
And don't get me wrong
In the scheme of things they do belong

And the laws of gravity and mechanics
just short of wonderful seem to stick
As long as conditions are under control
They have a very important role

So, let's move on,
What's my complaint?
Well, here it is- -let me explain
All things are in motion don't you see?
And now begins the special theory of relativity.

Now, standing here I'm not at rest
The earth moves, we need no test.
And riding round on this big orb
I'm moving awful fast, please, this point absorb
But that idea is rather grand
So let's consider a simpler plan.

I'm on a train and though it seems I'm standing still
The train is moving and so I will
Tend to move along at a similar rate
Looking out the window shows a rather rapid pace.

But to that fellow over there
I'm at rest, again, no test!

And look out there
A big black bird flying
We can agree at some velocity he is winging
Now what would be its spped if I weren't standing on this train?
If the earth weren't moving?
If ther could be truly flat planes?

What's my reference point as he speeds by?
Flapping his wings against a blue sky?

And if he could fly near the speed of light?
There's an equation I'd like to get right.


the speed you go...it all depends
The time it takes is relative
The distance too is something to debate
From all the you've known you must deviate

Now here's a part really hard to explain
The speed of light, it does not change
Standing still or zooming fast
You must become iconoclasts

Nothing that we know is any faster
The speed of light is the velocity master
Distance and time become subordinate to its rate
They must adjust themselves to the conditions it does create.

Can you believe it?!
Or do you think I'm nuts?
Please forgive me...but we must climb from a rut
Distance is relative and the time it takes is too
When the speed of light, the old rules, does undo.

Finis (If ianything is finis....)
...........................................
This next bit needs a little work yet but I'll
include it anyways:

And look, out there, a big black flying bird
He's moving too
Now what would be that speed if I weren't standing
on this train?
If the earth weren't moving quite so fast?
If the wind didn't send such bitter blasts?





this is from the jan 22 email

standing here I'm not at rest
The earth turns we need no test
We also know or so it seems
The speed of light is real extreme
Now here's the part hard to explain
The speed of light, it does not change
Standing still or zooming fast
You must become iconoclastss

Let go! Be free! I'm not insane.
The laws of physics must be rearranged.

Gravity is pretty nice
but it alone will not suffice

now the part that's really fun
Time itself must be undone
It's relative to your speed
blah blah blah blah......
this is where I came to a hault</pre>
<p><b>core dump follows from jan 20 meeting, the things you like are carolyn's the lame things are mine :-)</b></p>
<pre>It started, really, long ago
the Greeks, you see, began to think
looking high and looking low

they wanted everything nic
pythagoras, it’s said,
threw a fellow overboard
for speaking of the irrational

dlat planes and straight lines
come frome someone’s fancy
nothing but geometric games
neat an pretty
answers arranged so nice in a quiet room
can be sung to that old tune

newton did a lot of stuff
but gravity is quite enough

copernicus
galileo the church
did abhor
but even so there must be more

everyone so rigid
rigid sticks to measure with
stand real still
do not move
let’s measure the
unmeasureable

there’s v it stands for velocity
and c the speed of light
there’s m for mass and
e that’s energy

I scratch my head
I smoke my pipe
am I standing still?
What’s that ?!
a lightening flash
or was that 2

“No Rotation”
railroad of rhythm?

No matter the constant velocity
for of which we do prescribe
to this uniform translation
(we will not allow rotation)

therefore travelling from here to there
in a rigid straight line
let’s consider there’s such a
thing as a rigid straight
line devoid of rotation
(let’s not allow rotation)
Like the journey of a train
or a raven’s flying through the air
it’s all the same
I do not care

As far back as Galileo
and I won’t forget old Newton
though somewhat rigid
in this day and age
their Mechanical laws (laws of mechanics)
I certainly commend as little short of wonderful
it establishing a condition
of uniform motion in translation
(please don’t bring in rotation)

NOW with all this to conseider
relative to a raven flying up above
a train travelling/moving down below
and I may be standing


Don’t consider the stars
let’s forget themoon
don’t include a fance race car
circling round a high speed track
nothing on a rotational path
we won’t consider that

kiddies on a merry-go round
ballerinas twirling
none of these can be thought of right now
rotational paths we don’t allow

Klum:
Here I am
There are you
At night we gaze upon one moon
though alone we’re not two
gravitation sticks like glue
and toward each other we are pulled
how can I come to know
----
speed of light

what we preceive

when did it happen
at what moment did it  occur?
like lightening it seems to
        have struck me
        did it strike you?

oh who can we move faster
can I walk toward you

if a raven flys in a line
and is seen from an embankment
as flying uniformly
it is the same as looking
from the train that travels uniformly

that is because the laws of physics
are relative and don’t change
when you move in a line without accellerating

now if this weren’t true
and I played for you
a tune from an organ pipe
it would change a note
if I rotated it round
to the direction of travel

that is because the laws of physics
are relative and don’t change
when you move in a line without accellerating

now we know this is true
or the laws of nature would change
every day, every moment
as the earth swings round the sun
at 30 kilometers per second

that is because the laws of physics
are relative and don’t change
when you move in a line without accellerating

“the most careful observations
have never revealed such anisotropic
properties in terrestrian physical space
... this is a powerful argument
in favor of the principle of relativity.”

(simul)

There is an order to the universe
but what more can one know
I know that A is before B is before C
but not much more

time it seems is arbitrary
and two events cannot happen
at the same time for all frames of motion

when does the lightening strike
two places are they at the same time?
how do I know
every reference body has its own particular time

it has always been assumed
that the statement of time has absolute significance
but we need to discard this notion
if the speed of light in vacuo is the law
and relativity is valid

(behavior of rods &amp; clocks)

HK
the rigid rod is shorter when in motion than at rest
the more quickly it is moving the shorter that it gets
and for velocities greater than the speed of light
the length becomes imaginary
the speed of light cannot be reached nor exceeded by any real body

SH
as judged from k the clock has a uniform velocity of v
time which elapses between two ticks is not the same you see
as time on the clock that stay in place “at rest” beside me
one over the square root of one minus v squared over c squared
the clock in motion is far slower when to the one at rest compared

chorus
the key to unlock the mystery
is the heart of realativity
and the speed of light in vacuo
real objects can’t match or faster go</pre>
