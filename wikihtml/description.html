<div class="wikitext"><p>This is the somewhat rambling description that I presented to the Faculty on November 5, 2003</p>
<h2>Macbeth-SV</h2>
<p><img src="http://mathmos.org/images/first.jpg" alt="http://mathmos.org/images/first.jpg" class="inlineimage" /></p>
<p>&lt;Abstract&gt; Macbeth-SV is the tale of the fall of the famous Scotsman as told in contemporary San José through a modern medium, the cell phone. A single story arc is excerpted from the Bard’s classic tale of murder and descent and is presented to the city as a distributed theater performance. This is reminiscent of Augusto Boal’s invisible theater. The story follows four actors as they play out their destinies and knits together the stage through a shared conference call.</p>
<p>&lt;Story/Script&gt; The play is about murder and ambition. This project attempts to take Elizabethan literature and combine it with contemporary communication while quoting modern existence and questioning the motivations of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Macbeth is seen as the ambitious CEO of a company, suave, well dressed, and ruthless. He begins in an elevated position, where his ethical situation is as lofty as his physical location. After communicating with the witches he begins his descent through the blind ambition of his wife.</p>
<p>The story is reduced from 2 &amp; 1/2 hours to about 30 minutes but maintains the motivations of the characters and flavor of the original play.  Banquo stands in for Duncan (the king) and is the only person murdered on screen.</p>
<p>&lt;Why Cell Phones [<a href="http://mathmos.org/images/j3-pic.jpg" class="namedurl"><span style="white-space: nowrap"><img src="/phpwiki/themes/default/images/http.png" alt="http" class="linkicon" border="0" />http://mathmos.org/images/j3-pic.jpg</span></a>]&gt;Cell Phones represent the technology of the valley. Two zones of interaction are created by the use of a cell phone, personal and public.  The personal zone allows us to talk about the details of our lives and ignore the public. There is an implicit assumption that the private exchange will be ignored by people who overhear it however this is only true if the user is polite and the eavesdroppers are well mannered.  Theater creates a similar separation of zones between the audience and the players.  The expectation of privacy is on the audience’s part.  Cell phones allow a separation of the actors and extention of the stage by  connecting the actors’ performance and enabling the entire city to be used for the performance. This blurs the line between performer and audience, the public and the private.</p>
<p>&lt;Why Macbeth [<a href="http://mathmos.org/images/macbeth-polanski.jpg" class="namedurl"><span style="white-space: nowrap"><img src="/phpwiki/themes/default/images/http.png" alt="http" class="linkicon" border="0" />http://mathmos.org/images/macbeth-polanski.jpg</span></a>] [<a href="http://mathmos.org/images/scotland-pa.jpg" class="namedurl"><span style="white-space: nowrap"><img src="/phpwiki/themes/default/images/http.png" alt="http" class="linkicon" border="0" />http://mathmos.org/images/scotland-pa.jpg</span></a>]&gt;The play Macbeth was selected because of its relevance to ambitious dog-eat-dog business in the valley and throughout the country. I saw the witches as standing in for information technology and providing fuel for the ambitious Macbeth and his wife. I have always loved Shakespeare.  The Elizabethan English is alien yet familiar. The audience is forced to adjust their attentions unless they are intimately familiar with the work</p>
<p>&lt;Why DV&gt;Digital Video is my medium of choice for several reasons.  There is an abundance of good equipment, the cameras can be hand held and are very portable, they are able to remain stealthy. It is possible to shoot and synchronize with other footage.  The medium is easily edited and the distribution methods are inexpensive. It is also widely accepted.</p>
<p>DV made it possible to shoot in four locations at the same time, and then bring these different streams together as one finished piece.</p>
<p>&lt;Themes &gt;I have addressed many themes in the work.  For example Theater, Technology, Transportation, Architecture, Vector, Place, Altitude, Motion, and Reality Television are all represented. I shall touch on some of the more dominant themes at this point.</p>
<p>&lt;Routes&gt; [<a href="http://mathmos.org/images/map2-overlay.jpg" class="namedurl"><span style="white-space: nowrap"><img src="/phpwiki/themes/default/images/http.png" alt="http" class="linkicon" border="0" />http://mathmos.org/images/map2-overlay.jpg</span></a>] [<a href="http://mathmos.org/images/map2.jpg" class="namedurl"><span style="white-space: nowrap"><img src="/phpwiki/themes/default/images/http.png" alt="http" class="linkicon" border="0" />http://mathmos.org/images/map2.jpg</span></a>]&gt;
The paths of the characters were carefully chosen before shooting.  This included the path and angle of the camera accompanying the character. This allowed the inclusion of various pieces of architecture (through over the shoulder shots) and created an overall sense of the downtown area. The path that each character takes references that character and their destiny.</p>
<p>&lt;Vectors&gt;{ A vector is a quantity having direction as well as magnitude}.  This describes each of the characters and is embedded in their actions.  Macbeth descends, Lady Macbeth is fast moving, the Witches are a locus around which all things happen.</p>
<p>&lt;Banquo <a href="http://mathmos.org/movies/banquo.mov" class="namedurl"><span style="white-space: nowrap"><img src="/phpwiki/themes/default/images/http.png" alt="http" class="linkicon" border="0" />http://mathmos.org/movies/banquo.mov</span></a>&gt;
Banquo is the worker in the valley, he is everyman, he tries to remain honorable but ends up being used. He is the honest pawn of fate and the true friend of Macbeth. He is railroaded by the Macbeth's ambition. Banquo moves at a walking pace, is murdered in the Fairmont and his spirit stumbles its way to haunt Lady Macbeth who has motivated the murder.</p>
<p>&lt;Weird Sisters <a href="http://mathmos.org/movies/wierd-sisters.mov" class="namedurl"><span style="white-space: nowrap"><img src="/phpwiki/themes/default/images/http.png" alt="http" class="linkicon" border="0" />http://mathmos.org/movies/wierd-sisters.mov</span></a>&gt;
The Weird Sisters represent technology as motivator, the Witches directly manipulate Macbeth by telling him of his future, they provide information which is void of ethical direction or force. The witches are a center around which all motion occurs. They are stationary, yet pivotal. They drive all action without directing it explicitly. They awaken Macbeth to his own ambition, and manipulate all of characters throughout the play with their spell casting over the phones.</p>
<p>&lt;Lady M <a href="http://mathmos.org/movies/ladym.mov" class="namedurl"><span style="white-space: nowrap"><img src="/phpwiki/themes/default/images/http.png" alt="http" class="linkicon" border="0" />http://mathmos.org/movies/ladym.mov</span></a>&gt;
Lady Macbeth represents the motivating force, and provides direction to Macbeth. She is fast moving, and driven. Lady Macbeth is chauffeured in a yellow Mustang convertible. She indirectly serves the witches by culling Macbeths ambition she is the fastest character. She covers the entire area of the play nearly missing Banquo at the beginning and waiting within shouting distance of the witches as he is murdered. She eventually loses her motive power as the weight of her deed sets in and it becomes apparent that she was not able to sink as low as Macbeth. She is haunted at Starbucks and eventually kills herself to find the spirit of Banquo with her.</p>
<p>&lt;Macbeth <a href="http://mathmos.org/movies/macb.mov" class="namedurl"><span style="white-space: nowrap"><img src="/phpwiki/themes/default/images/http.png" alt="http" class="linkicon" border="0" />http://mathmos.org/movies/macb.mov</span></a>&gt;
Macbeth descends because of his ambition and that of his wife. He falls both morally and physically. Macbeth is in a state of decline throughout the play. His vector is down and his velocity is increasing. He is tempted by the foretelling of his future and moved forward by his wife. Due to his ambition he moves at a walking pace and is free to choose his direction but ends up locked into a path that eventually delivers him to the witches completely.</p>
<p>&lt;Reality TV&gt;This works aesthetics are conceived in Reality television. The shooting style, camera movement, omnipresent camera eye come directly from Reality TV.</p>
<p>Reality Television is not new.  It began in 1948 with Candid Camera, through 1973’s An American Family, to 1989 with Fox TV’s Cops. Today television is awash with variations on variations of seasons past.  “Reality Television” is however no more real than theater, generally it is not scripted per se, but the director will choose the bad guy and the editor will make sure that is what the audience sees.  The reality of this television is no more real than that of the scripts of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>&lt;Dr. Augusto Boal &gt;The work is equally inspired by the theories and theater of Augusto Boal.</p>
<p>Born in Rio de Janeiro received his PhD from Columbia University. Afterwards he worked in Sao Paulo Brazil in the Arena Theatre. Boal liked to know the reaction of the audience, and so invited their discussions following the performance. He then began allowing the audience to stop the play and offer suggestions to the actors on how they should perform! He also let them offer up suggestion on changes for the stage and set! He saw theatre as a very interactive process.</p>
<p>1971 Boal wrote The Theatre of the Oppressed. This book offered games and exercises for actors and non-actors alike. After publication, he was arrested, tortured and exiled. He went to Argentina, and then moved on to Europe. In 1981 he organized the first International Festival of the Theatre of the Oppressed in Paris, France. He also began establishing several Centers for the Theatre of the Oppressed.</p>
<p>&lt;Invisible theater&gt;</p>
<p><img src="http://mathmos.org/images/lm-banquo.jpg" alt="http://mathmos.org/images/lm-banquo.jpg" class="inlineimage" /></p>
<p>Boal also created Invisible Theater.</p>
<p>Invisible theatre is theatre, which has been taken to the streets. The public (audience) sees events unfolding which they deem to be "real events" but which are later revealed as theatre. This is a very powerful method of eliciting real emotions from an unsuspecting audience.</p>
<p>It is a controversial form of theatre.... when and where is it appropriate?? What about ethics?? When does it go too far or become too much? Truth is revealed by the nature of not knowing that you are the audience of a preconceived "act".</p>
<p>From Invisible Theater I took the guerilla shooting and the public performance.  The viewer is not aware that the person ranting into a cell phone is in fact Macbeth preparing to kill his friend Banquo unless he violates that persons implied privacy. The characters repeatedly talk of murder, blood and guilt in public with little more than a stare coming from the audience.  The clues that this is theater are readily available in the cameras and the language.</p>
<p>From watching the video it is appearant that some people realized what was going on, but that most just ignored the performance.</p>
<p>&lt;Conclusion:&gt;This performance creates a film that places narrative characters in an environment that reflects their motives.</p>
<p>It adopts new concepts of audience; it crosses boundaries of film, theater and conceptual art. The work examines SV through the lens of Elizabethan literature.</p>
<p>Macbeth-SV deconstructs theater and contemporary society.  It moves the audience to the stage and distributes the stage among the city.</p>
