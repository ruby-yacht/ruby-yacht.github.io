<div class="wikitext"><p>Shakespeare incorporated 3 witches into the play and gave them some incantations to recite. Legend has it that the spells Shakespeare included in Macbeth were lifted from an authentic black-magic ritual and that their public display did not please the folks for whom these incantations were sacred. And so, they retaliated with a curse on the show and all its productions.</p>
<p>The curse seemed to take effect from the very first play. Hal Berridge was to play Lady Macbeth at the play's opening on August 7, 1606. Unfortunately, he was stricken with a sudden fever and died. And this was just the beginning..</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1934, actor Malcolm Keen turned mute onstage, and his replacement, Alistair Sim, like Hal Berridge before him, developed a high fever and had to be hospitalized.</li>
<li>In a performance in Amsterdam in 1672, the actor in the title role is said to have used a real dagger for the scene in which he murders Duncan and done the deed for real.</li>
<li>When the play was performed in London in 1703, on the opening day, England was hit with one of the most violent storms in its history.</li>
<li>in 1721, a nobleman who was watching the show from the stage decided to get up in the middle of a scene, walk across the stage, and talk to a friend. The actors, upset by this, drew their swords and chased the nobleman and his friends from the theatre. The noblemen returned later with the militia and burned the theatre down!</li>
<li>In 1775, Sarah Siddons was playing the role Lady Macbeth and was practically ravaged by a disapproving audience.</li>
<li>May 10, 1849, Macbeth was being performed at the Astor Place Opera House when a crowd of more than 10,000 New Yorkers gathered to protest the appearance of British actor William Charles Macready.  The protest turned into a terrible riot, and it resulted in the militia firing into the crowd. Twenty-three people were killed, 36 were wounded, and hundreds were injured.</li>
<li>Abraham Lincoln was reading passages aloud to a party of friends, passages following the scene in which Duncan is assassinated whilst taking a cruise on board the River Queen on the Potomac River on April 9, 1865.. Within a week, Lincoln himself was dead by a murderer's hand.</li>
<li>In 1926, Sybil Thorndike was almost strangled by an actor.</li>
<li>In 1882, on the closing night,J. H. Barnes, an actor, was engaged in a scene of swordplay with another actor named William Rignold when Barnes accidentally thrust his sword directly into Rignold's chest. Luckily Barnes lived.</li>
<li>In 1988, the Broadway production starring Glenda Jackson and Christoper Plummer is supposed to have gone through three directors, five Macduffs, six cast changes, six stage managers, two set designers, two lighting designers, 26 bouts of flu, many torn ligaments and groin injuries.</li>
<li>In 1937, a 25 pound stage weight crashed within an inch of Laurence Olivier (who was playing Macbeth). Not only that, but his sword broke on stage flew into the audience, hitting a man who later suffered a heart attack. And in the same production,both the director and the actress playing Lady Macduff were involved in a car accident on the way to the theater, and the proprietor of the theater died of a heart attack during the dress rehearsal.</li>
<li>In 1998, in the Off-Broadway production starring Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett, Baldwin somehow sliced open the hand of his Macduff.</li>
</ul>
<p>and these are only a handfull of the stories...there are hundreds more.</p>
<p>It is said that the curse does not allow anyone to say the play's name inside of the theater(although saying "Macbeth" within the context of the script doesn't seem to matter), and hence it has become known by many other names such as The Scottish Play, The Scottish Tragedy, The Unmentionable, or even just "that play"</p>
<p>If you do mention the play's name, you must immediately leave the room, turn around 3 times to the right, spit over each shoulder, utter a profainity, knock on the door of the room, and request to be allowed to re-enter. or as an alternative, you might be able to get away with saying,  "Thrice around the circle bound, Evil sink into the ground."</p>
