<div class="wikitext"><p>1. MACBETH</p>
<p>2. Persons Represented</p>
<p>3. MACBETH</p>
<p>4. BANQUO</p>
<p>5. LADY MACBETH</p>
<p>6. THREE WITCHES</p>
<p>7. SCENE I. An open Place. Thunder and Lightning.</p>
<p>8. [Enter three Witches.]</p>
<p>9. FIRST WITCH.</p>
<p>10. When shall we three meet again?</p>
<p>11. In thunder, lightning, or in rain?</p>
<p>12. SECOND WITCH.</p>
<p>13. When the hurlyburly's done,</p>
<p>14. When the battle's lost and won.</p>
<p>15. THIRD WITCH.</p>
<p>16. That will be ere the set of sun.</p>
<p>17. FIRST WITCH.</p>
<p>18. Where the place?</p>
<p>19. SECOND WITCH.</p>
<p>20. Upon the heath.</p>
<p>21. THIRD WITCH.</p>
<p>22. There to meet with Macbeth.</p>
<p>23. ALL.</p>
<p>24. Fair is foul, and foul is fair:</p>
<p>25. Hover through the fog and filthy air.</p>
<p>26. [Witches vanish.]</p>
<p>27. BANQUO.</p>
<p>28. What bloody man is that? He can report,</p>
<p>29. As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt</p>
<p>30. The newest state.[ . . .] pronounce his present death,</p>
<p>31. And with his former title greet Macbeth.</p>
<p>32. What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.</p>
<p>33. [Thunder. Enter the three Witches.]</p>
<p>34. [Drum within.]</p>
<p>35. THIRD WITCH.</p>
<p>36. A drum, a drum!</p>
<p>37. Macbeth doth come.</p>
<p>38. ALL.</p>
<p>39. The weird sisters, hand in hand,</p>
<p>40. Posters of the sea and land,</p>
<p>41. Thus do go about, about:</p>
<p>42. Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,</p>
<p>43. And thrice again, to make up nine:--</p>
<p>44. Peace!--the charm's wound up.</p>
<p>45. [Enter Macbeth and Banquo.]</p>
<p>46. MACBETH.</p>
<p>47. So foul and fair a day I have not seen.</p>
<p>48. BANQUO.</p>
<p>49. How far is't call'd to Forres?--What are these</p>
<p>50. So wither'd, and so wild in their attire,</p>
<p>51. That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,</p>
<p>52. And yet are on't?--Live you? or are you aught</p>
<p>53. That man may question?</p>
<p>54. MACBETH.</p>
<p>55. Speak, if you can;--what are you?</p>
<p>56. FIRST WITCH.</p>
<p>57. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!</p>
<p>58. SECOND WITCH.</p>
<p>59. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!</p>
<p>60. THIRD WITCH.</p>
<p>61. All hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!</p>
<p>62. BANQUO.</p>
<p>63. Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear</p>
<p>64. Things that do sound so fair?-- I' the name of truth,</p>
<p>65. Are ye fantastical? [ . . . ] My noble partner</p>
<p>66. You greet with present grace and great prediction</p>
<p>67. Of noble having and of royal hope. . . .</p>
<p>68. If you can look into the seeds of time,</p>
<p>69. And say which grain will grow, and which will not,</p>
<p>70. Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear</p>
<p>71. Your favors nor your hate.</p>
<p>72. FIRST WITCH.</p>
<p>73. Hail!</p>
<p>74. SECOND WITCH.</p>
<p>75. Hail!</p>
<p>76. THIRD WITCH.</p>
<p>77. Hail!</p>
<p>78. FIRST WITCH.</p>
<p>79. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.</p>
<p>80. SECOND WITCH.</p>
<p>81. Not so happy, yet much happier.</p>
<p>82. THIRD WITCH.</p>
<p>83. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:</p>
<p>84. So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!</p>
<p>85. FIRST WITCH.</p>
<p>86. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!</p>
<p>87. MACBETH.</p>
<p>88. Stay, you imperfect speakers. Say from whence</p>
<p>89. You owe this strange intelligence?</p>
<p>90. [Witches vanish.]</p>
<p>91. BANQUO.</p>
<p>92. The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,</p>
<p>93. And these are of them:--whither are they vanish'd?</p>
<p>94. MACBETH.</p>
<p>95. Your children shall be kings.</p>
<p>96. BANQUO.</p>
<p>97. You shall be king.</p>
<p>98. MACBETH</p>
<p>99. Do you not hope your children shall be kings?</p>
<p>100. BANQUO.</p>
<p>101. 'Tis strange: oftentimes to win us to our harm,</p>
<p>102. The instruments of darkness tell us truths;</p>
<p>103. Win us with honest trifles, to betray's</p>
<p>104. In deepest consequence.--</p>
<p>105. MACBETH.</p>
<p>106. [Aside.] This supernatural soliciting</p>
<p>107. Cannot be ill; cannot be good:--if ill,</p>
<p>108. Why hath it given me earnest of success,</p>
<p>109. Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:</p>
<p>110. If good, why do I yield to that suggestion</p>
<p>111. Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,</p>
<p>112. And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,</p>
<p>113. Against the use of nature? Present fears</p>
<p>114. Are less than horrible imaginings:</p>
<p>115. My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,</p>
<p>116. Shakes so my single state of mind, that function</p>
<p>117. Is smother'd in surmise; and nothing is</p>
<p>118. But what is not.</p>
<p>119. SCENE . Inverness. A Room in Macbeth's Castle.</p>
<p>120. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>121. Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be</p>
<p>122. What thou art promis'd; yet do I fear thy nature;</p>
<p>123. It is too full o' the milk of human kindness</p>
<p>124. To catch the nearest way: " Hie thee hither,</p>
<p>125. That I may pour my spirits in thine ear.</p>
<p>126. The raven himself is hoarse</p>
<p>127. That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan</p>
<p>128. Under my battlements. Come, you spirits</p>
<p>129. That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here;</p>
<p>130. And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full</p>
<p>131. Of direst cruelty!  Come to my woman's breasts,</p>
<p>132. And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,</p>
<p>133. Wherever in your sightless substances</p>
<p>134. You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,</p>
<p>135. And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell</p>
<p>136. That my keen knife see not the wound it makes</p>
<p>137. Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark</p>
<p>138. To cry, "Hold, hold!"</p>
<p>139. [Enter Macbeth.]</p>
<p>140. Great Glamis! Worthy Cawdor!</p>
<p>141. Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!</p>
<p>142. Thy letters have transported me beyond</p>
<p>143. This ignorant present, and I feel now</p>
<p>144. The future in the instant.</p>
<p>145. MACBETH.</p>
<p>146. My dearest love,</p>
<p>147. Duncan comes here tonight.</p>
<p>148. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>149. And when goes hence?</p>
<p>150. MACBETH.</p>
<p>151. To-morrow,--as he purposes.</p>
<p>152. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>153. O, never</p>
<p>154. Shall sun that morrow see!</p>
<p>155. Your face, my thane, is as a book where men</p>
<p>156. May read strange matters:--to beguile the time,</p>
<p>157. Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,</p>
<p>158. Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,</p>
<p>159. But be the serpent under't. He that's coming</p>
<p>160. Must be provided for: and you shall put</p>
<p>161. This night's great business into my despatch.</p>
<p>162. MACBETH.</p>
<p>163. We will speak further.</p>
<p>164. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>165. Only look up clear;</p>
<p>166. To alter favor ever is to fear:</p>
<p>167. Leave all the rest to me.</p>
<p>168. . . . .</p>
<p>169. BANQUO.</p>
<p>170. This guest of summer,</p>
<p>171. The temple-haunting martlet, does approve</p>
<p>172. By his lov'd mansionry, that the heaven's breath</p>
<p>173. Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze, buttress,</p>
<p>174. Nor coigne of vantage, but this bird hath made</p>
<p>175. His pendant bed and procreant cradle:</p>
<p>176. Where they most breed and haunt, I have observ'd</p>
<p>177. The air is delicate.</p>
<p>178. [Enter Macbeth.]</p>
<p>179. MACBETH.</p>
<p>180. If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well</p>
<p>181. It were done quickly. If the assassination</p>
<p>182. Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,</p>
<p>183. With his surcease, success; that but this blow</p>
<p>184. Might be the be-all and the end-all--here,</p>
<p>185. But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,--</p>
<p>186. We'd jump the life to come. . . Besides, this Duncan</p>
<p>187. Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been</p>
<p>188. So clear in his great office, that his virtues</p>
<p>189. Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against</p>
<p>190. The deep damnation of his taking-off:</p>
<p>191. And pity, like a naked new-born babe,</p>
<p>192. Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin, hors'd</p>
<p>193. Upon the sightless couriers of the air,</p>
<p>194. Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,</p>
<p>195. That tears shall drown the wind.--I have no spur</p>
<p>196. To prick the sides of my intent, but only</p>
<p>197. Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself,</p>
<p>198. And falls on the other.</p>
<p>199. [Enter Lady Macbeth.]</p>
<p>200. How now! what news?</p>
<p>201. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>202. He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?</p>
<p>203. MACBETH.</p>
<p>204. Hath he ask'd for me?</p>
<p>205. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>206. Know you not he has?</p>
<p>207. MACBETH.</p>
<p>208. We will proceed no further in this business:</p>
<p>209. He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought</p>
<p>210. Golden opinions from all sorts of people,</p>
<p>211. Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,</p>
<p>212. Not cast aside so soon.</p>
<p>213. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>214. Was the hope drunk</p>
<p>215. Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?</p>
<p>216. And wakes it now, to look so green and pale</p>
<p>217. At what it did so freely? From this time</p>
<p>218. Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard</p>
<p>219. To be the same in thine own act and valor</p>
<p>220. As thou art in desire?</p>
<p>221. MACBETH.</p>
<p>222. Pr'ythee, peace!</p>
<p>223. I dare do all that may become a man;</p>
<p>224. Who dares do more is none.</p>
<p>225. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>226. What beast was't, then,</p>
<p>227. That made you break this enterprise to me?</p>
<p>228. When you durst do it, then you were a man;</p>
<p>229. . . . .  I have given suck, and know</p>
<p>230. How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:</p>
<p>231. I would, while it was smiling in my face,</p>
<p>232. Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums</p>
<p>233. And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you</p>
<p>234. Have done to this.</p>
<p>235. MACBETH.</p>
<p>236. If we should fail?</p>
<p>237. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>238. We fail!</p>
<p>239. But screw your courage to the sticking-place,</p>
<p>240. And we'll not fail.</p>
<p>241. MACBETH.</p>
<p>242. I am settled, and bend up</p>
<p>243. Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.</p>
<p>244. Away, and mock the time with fairest show:</p>
<p>245. False face must hide what the false heart doth know.</p>
<p>246. [Exeunt.]</p>
<p>247. BANQUO.</p>
<p>248. A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,</p>
<p>249. And yet I would not sleep:--merciful powers,</p>
<p>250. Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature</p>
<p>251. Gives way to in repose!--</p>
<p>252. Who's there?</p>
<p>253. MACBETH.</p>
<p>254. A friend.</p>
<p>255. BANQUO.</p>
<p>256. All's well.</p>
<p>257. I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:</p>
<p>258. To you they have show'd some truth.</p>
<p>259. MACBETH.</p>
<p>260. I think not of them:</p>
<p>261. Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,</p>
<p>262. We would spend it in some words upon that business,</p>
<p>263. If you would grant the time.</p>
<p>264. BANQUO.</p>
<p>265. At your kind'st leisure.</p>
<p>266. MACBETH.</p>
<p>267. If you shall cleave to my consent,--when 'tis,</p>
<p>268. It shall make honor for you.</p>
<p>269. BANQUO.</p>
<p>270. So I lose none</p>
<p>271. In seeking to augment it, but still keep</p>
<p>272. My bosom franchis'd, and allegiance clear,</p>
<p>273. I shall be counsell'd.</p>
<p>274. MACBETH.</p>
<p>275. Good repose the while!</p>
<p>276. BANQUO.</p>
<p>277. Thanks, sir: the like to you!</p>
<p>278. MACBETH</p>
<p>279. Is this a dagger which I see before me,</p>
<p>280. The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:--</p>
<p>281. I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.</p>
<p>282. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible</p>
<p>283. To feeling as to sight? or art thou but</p>
<p>284. A dagger of the mind, a false creation,</p>
<p>285. Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?</p>
<p>286. Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,</p>
<p>287. Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;</p>
<p>288. And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,</p>
<p>289. Which was not so before.--There's no such thing:</p>
<p>290. It is the bloody business which informs</p>
<p>291. Thus to mine eyes.--Now o'er the one half-world</p>
<p>292. Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse</p>
<p>293. The curtain'd sleep;  [. . . ] Thou sure and firm-set earth,</p>
<p>294. Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear</p>
<p>295. Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,</p>
<p>296. And take the present horror from the time,</p>
<p>297. Which now suits with it.--Whiles I threat, he lives;</p>
<p>298. Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.</p>
<p>299. [A bell rings.]</p>
<p>300. I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.</p>
<p>301. Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell</p>
<p>302. That summons thee to heaven or to hell.</p>
<p>303. [Exit.]</p>
<p>304. [Enter Lady Macbeth.]</p>
<p>305. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>306. That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold:</p>
<p>307. What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.--Hark!--Peace!</p>
<p>308. It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,</p>
<p>309. Which gives the stern'st good night. He is about it:</p>
<p>310. The doors are open--</p>
<p>311. MACBETH.</p>
<p>312. [Within.] Who's there?--what, ho!</p>
<p>313. [Re-enter Macbeth.]</p>
<p>314. MACBETH.</p>
<p>315. I have done the deed.--Didst thou not hear a noise?</p>
<p>316. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>317. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.</p>
<p>318. Did not you speak?</p>
<p>319. MACBETH.</p>
<p>320. When?</p>
<p>321. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>322. Now.</p>
<p>323. MACBETH.</p>
<p>324. As I descended?</p>
<p>325. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>326. Ay.</p>
<p>327. MACBETH. [Looking on his hands.]</p>
<p>328. This is a sorry sight.</p>
<p>329. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>330. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.</p>
<p>331. These deeds must not be thought</p>
<p>332. After these ways; so, it will make us mad.</p>
<p>333. MACBETH.</p>
<p>334. I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!</p>
<p>335. Macbeth does murder sleep,"</p>
<p>336. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>337. Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,</p>
<p>338. You do unbend your noble strength to think</p>
<p>339. So brainsickly of things.--Go get some water,</p>
<p>340. And wash this filthy witness from your hand.--</p>
<p>341. MACBETH.</p>
<p>342. I'll go no more:</p>
<p>343. I am afraid to think what I have done;</p>
<p>344. Look on't again I dare not.</p>
<p>345. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>346. Infirm of purpose! The sleeping and the dead</p>
<p>347. Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood</p>
<p>348. That fears a painted devil.</p>
<p>349. [Exit. Knocking within.]</p>
<p>350. MACBETH.</p>
<p>351. Whence is that knocking?</p>
<p>352. How is't with me, when every noise appals me?</p>
<p>353. What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!</p>
<p>354. Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood</p>
<p>355. Clean from my hand? No; this my hand will rather</p>
<p>356. The multitudinous seas incarnadine,</p>
<p>357. Making the green one red.</p>
<p>358. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>359. A little water clears us of this deed:</p>
<p>360. How easy is it then! [ . . . ] be not lost</p>
<p>361. So poorly in your thoughts.</p>
<p>362. MACBETH.</p>
<p>363. To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself. [Knocking within.]</p>
<p>364. Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!</p>
<p>365. [Exeunt.]</p>
<p>366. SCENE. Another Room in the Palace.</p>
<p>367. [Enter Lady Macbeth]</p>
<p>368. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>369. Naught's had, all's spent,</p>
<p>370. Where our desire is got without content:</p>
<p>371. 'Tis safer to be that which we destroy,</p>
<p>372. Than, by destruction, dwell in doubtful joy.</p>
<p>373. MACBETH.</p>
<p>374. We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it;</p>
<p>375. She'll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice</p>
<p>376. Remains in danger of her former tooth.</p>
<p>377. But let the frame of things disjoint,</p>
<p>378. Both the worlds suffer,</p>
<p>379. Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep</p>
<p>380. In the affliction of these terrible dreams</p>
<p>381. That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,</p>
<p>382. Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,</p>
<p>383. Than on the torture of the mind to lie</p>
<p>384. In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;</p>
<p>385. After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;</p>
<p>386. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>387. Come on;</p>
<p>388. Gently my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;</p>
<p>389. Be bright and jovial 'mong your guests to-night.</p>
<p>390. MACBETH.</p>
<p>391. So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:</p>
<p>392. Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;</p>
<p>393. Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:</p>
<p>394. Unsafe the while, that we</p>
<p>395. Must lave our honors in these flattering streams;</p>
<p>396. And make our faces vizards to our hearts,</p>
<p>397. Disguising what they are.</p>
<p>398. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>399. You must leave this.</p>
<p>400. MACBETH.</p>
<p>401. O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!</p>
<p>402. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>403. What's to be done?</p>
<p>404. MACBETH.</p>
<p>405. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,</p>
<p>406. Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,</p>
<p>407. Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;</p>
<p>408. And with thy bloody and invisible hand</p>
<p>409. Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond</p>
<p>410. Which keeps me pale!--Light thickens; and the crow</p>
<p>411. Makes wing to the rooky wood:</p>
<p>412. Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;</p>
<p>413. Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse.--</p>
<p>414. Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;</p>
<p>415. Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill:</p>
<p>416. [Exeunt.]</p>
<p>417. MACBETH.</p>
<p>418. It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:</p>
<p>419. Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak;</p>
<p>420. Augurs, and understood relations, have</p>
<p>421. By magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth</p>
<p>422. The secret'st man of blood.--What is the night?</p>
<p>423. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>424. Almost at odds with morning, which is which.</p>
<p>425. MACBETH.</p>
<p>426. All causes shall give way: I am in blood</p>
<p>427. Step't in so far that, should I wade no more,</p>
<p>428. Returning were as tedious as go o'er:</p>
<p>429. Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;</p>
<p>430. Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.</p>
<p>431. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>432. You lack the season of all natures, sleep.</p>
<p>433. MACBETH.</p>
<p>434. Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse</p>
<p>435. Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:--</p>
<p>436. We are yet but young in deed.</p>
<p>437. [Exeunt.]</p>
<p>438. SCENE I. A dark Cave. In the middle, a Caldron Boiling.</p>
<p>439. ALL.</p>
<p>440. Double, double, toil and trouble;</p>
<p>441. Fire, burn; and caldron, bubble.</p>
<p>442. SECOND WITCH.</p>
<p>443. Cool it with a baboon's blood,</p>
<p>444. Then the charm is firm and good.</p>
<p>445. SECOND WITCH.</p>
<p>446. By the pricking of my thumbs,</p>
<p>447. Something wicked this way comes:--</p>
<p>448. Open, locks, whoever knocks!</p>
<p>449. [Enter Macbeth.]</p>
<p>450. MACBETH.</p>
<p>451. How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!</p>
<p>452. What is't you do?</p>
<p>453. ALL.</p>
<p>454. A deed without a name.</p>
<p>455. MACBETH.</p>
<p>456. I conjure you, by that which you profess,--</p>
<p>457. Howe'er you come to know it,--answer me:</p>
<p>458. Though you untie the winds, and let them fight</p>
<p>459. Against the churches; though the yesty waves</p>
<p>460. Confound and swallow navigation up;</p>
<p>461. Though bladed corn be lodg'd, and trees blown down;</p>
<p>462. Though castles topple on their warders' heads;</p>
<p>463. Though palaces and pyramids do slope</p>
<p>464. Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure</p>
<p>465. Of nature's germins tumble all together,</p>
<p>466. Even till destruction sicken,--answer me</p>
<p>467. To what I ask you.</p>
<p>468. ALL.</p>
<p>469. Seek to know no more.</p>
<p>470. MACBETH.</p>
<p>471. I will be satisfied: deny me this,</p>
<p>472. And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know:</p>
<p>473. FIRST WITCH.</p>
<p>474. Show!</p>
<p>475. SECOND WITCH.</p>
<p>476. Show!</p>
<p>477. THIRD WITCH.</p>
<p>478. Show!</p>
<p>479. ALL.</p>
<p>480. Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;</p>
<p>481. Come like shadows, so depart!</p>
<p>482. [Banquo appears.]</p>
<p>483. MACBETH.</p>
<p>484. Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo; down!</p>
<p>485. Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs:--.--Filthy hags!</p>
<p>486. Why do you show me this? --Start, eyes!</p>
<p>487. What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?</p>
<p>488. Horrible sight!--Now I see 'tis true;</p>
<p>489. For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,</p>
<p>490. And points at them for his.--What! is this so?</p>
<p>491. FIRST WITCH.</p>
<p>492. Ay, sir, all this is so:--but why</p>
<p>493. Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?--</p>
<p>494. Come,sisters, cheer we up his sprites,</p>
<p>495. And show the best of our delights;</p>
<p>496. I'll charm the air to give a sound,</p>
<p>497. While you perform your antic round;</p>
<p>498. That this great king may kindly say,</p>
<p>499. Our duties did his welcome pay.</p>
<p>500. [Music. The Witches dance, and then vanish.]</p>
<p>501. MACBETH.</p>
<p>502. Where are they? Gone?--Let this pernicious hour</p>
<p>503. Stand aye accursed in the calendar!--</p>
<p>504. SCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.</p>
<p>505. [Enter Lady Macbeth, with a taper.]</p>
<p>506. LADY MACBETH.</p>
<p>507. Yet here's a spot--</p>
<p>508. Out, damned spot! out, I say!-- One; two; why, then 'tis</p>
<p>509. time to do't ;--Hell is murky!--Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier,</p>
<p>510. and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can</p>
<p>511. call our power to account?--Yet who would have thought</p>
<p>512. the man to have had so much blood in him?</p>
<p>513. . . . .</p>
<p>514. The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now?--What,</p>
<p>515. will these hands ne'er be clean? No more o' that, my lord, no</p>
<p>516. more o' that: you mar all with this starting.</p>
<p>517. . . . .</p>
<p>518. Here's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes</p>
<p>519. of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!</p>
<p>520. . . . .</p>
<p>521. Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so</p>
<p>522. pale:--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come</p>
<p>523. out on's grave.</p>
<p>524. . . . .</p>
<p>525. To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate: come, come, come,</p>
<p>526. come, give me your hand: what's done cannot be undone:</p>
<p>i. to bed, to bed, to bed.</p>
<p>527. SCENE. Dunsinane. Within the castle.</p>
<p>528. [A cry of women within.]</p>
<p>529. MACBETH.</p>
<p>530. What is that noise?</p>
<p>531. MACBETH.</p>
<p>532. I have almost forgot the taste of fears:</p>
<p>533. The time has been, my senses would have cool'd</p>
<p>534. To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair</p>
<p>535. Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir</p>
<p>536. As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;</p>
<p>537. Direness, familiar to my slaught'rous thoughts,</p>
<p>538. Cannot once start me.</p>
<p>539. Wherefore was that cry?</p>
<p>540. WITCH.</p>
<p>541. The queen, my lord, is dead.</p>
<p>542. MACBETH.</p>
<p>543. She should have died hereafter;</p>
<p>544. There would have been a time for such a word.--</p>
<p>545. To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,</p>
<p>546. Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,</p>
<p>547. To the last syllable of recorded time;</p>
<p>548. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</p>
<p>549. The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!</p>
<p>550. Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player,</p>
<p>551. That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,</p>
<p>552. And then is heard no more: it is a tale</p>
<p>553. Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</p>
<p>554. Signifying nothing.</p>
