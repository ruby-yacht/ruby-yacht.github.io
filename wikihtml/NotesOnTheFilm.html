<div class="wikitext"><p>Macbeth, ‘The Silicon Valley Play’ or Macbeth-SV</p>
<p>Description/Abstract:</p>
<p>This is the tale of the fall of the famous Scotsman as told in contemporary San José through a modern medium, the cell phone.  A single story arc is excerpted from the Bard’s classic tale of murder and descent and is presented to the city as a distributed theater piece.  This is reminiscent of Boal’s invisible theater.  The story follows four actors as they play out their destinies and knits together the stage through a shared conference call.</p>
<p>Detail/Theory:</p>
<p>Macbeth-SV is a collision of the systems theater and the cell phone. As one walks the streets one sees people who are in public, but who have their attention somewhere else.   Macbeth-SV takes contemporary theater, classic theater, reality television, contemporary lifestyle and weaves them together as public performance. Selected scenes were performed from “The Scottish Play” of William Shakespeare in real time in public spaces.  These performances were connected immediately by cell phone, and eventually through documentation by video.  Each “unit” consisted of an actor and a camera operator, which performed for the public. The viewers were treated to a small slice of the play, which was portrayed by the character they were near. This method caused location to question the characters, the city to become the stage. To the casual observer this appeared to be a lunatic ranting into a phone. The more studied observer noticed the camera and that there was a performance of Shakespeare in progress.</p>
<p>What is this about?</p>
<p>The play is about murder and ambition. This project attempts to take Elizabethan literature and combine it with contemporary communication while quoting modern existence and questioning the motivations of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The play takes place in contemporary San José.  Macbeth is seen as the ambitious CEO of a company, suave, well dressed, and ruthless.  He begins in an elevated position, where his ethical situation is as lofty as his physical spot.  After communicating with the witches he begins his descent into the blind ambition of his wife.</p>
<p>The characters carry out virtually all interaction through their cell phones.  The players move from place to place providing their surrounding area with a “taste of Macbeth” and move on.</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<p>The work was shot as a single take on four cameras running at the same time. In my mind this “one take” is more than a gimmick, it is what makes this performance theater.  For me this is an important distinction.  As a form of postmodern theater it is different from other films, and becomes more than a rehashing of the story of Macbeth.</p>
<p>I have discarded the visual aesthetics of film in favor of a more documentary / reality TV style.  This piece is as much a documentation of a performance as it is a work of art unto itself.</p>
<p>Finally a certain amount of dissatisfaction is maintained in the piece.  Once the viewer realizes that there are 4 continuous DV streams running through the whole presentation, there is a desire to know what transpired in each of them.  As an example the witches are always entertaining in their conjuring and gaiety, but the viewer of this piece cannot fully apprehend that. They are denied access to that stream.  The casual viewer of the witches would have seen their obscene romp, but have missed the other players. No one is permitted to see everything.</p>
