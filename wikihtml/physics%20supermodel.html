<div class="wikitext"><p>Known as string theory (or more accurately, M-theory), it promises to unite all of the known models of physics -- covering electromagnetism, nuclear forces, and gravity -- into one all-encompassing supermodel.  The fundamental units of this supermodel are known as “strings,” or one-dimensional vibrating chords, and from the various types of “notes” that these fundamental strings play, one can derive every known particle and force in the cosmos.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fsbassociates.com/shambhala/theoryofeverything.htm" class="namedurl"><span style="white-space: nowrap"><img src="/phpwiki/themes/default/images/http.png" alt="http" class="linkicon" border="0" />http://www.fsbassociates.com/shambhala/theoryofeverything.htm</span></a></p>
<p>so here is the standard model and here is a super model</p>
<p>M-THEORY AND POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS TO THAT THEORY:  The modification differs from the standard theory in that the universe starts with two separate space-times.  One is a 2D manifold that meets the requirements for a Near-Kerr solution to Blackhole Geometrodynamics in 2D format.  The other is a 6D Higgs type space-time of a size greater than 10^50th power in light years.  The first starts smaller than the Plank scale by an equal amount.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>String Theory from its start was based upon another theory called <span class="wikiunknown"><a href="SuperSymetry?action=edit" title="Edit: SuperSymetry" onmouseover="window.status=&quot;Edit: SuperSymetry&quot;; return true;" onmouseout="window.status='';return true;">?</a><u>SuperSymetry</u></span>.  With SUSY type theories all matter have their counter-part in force carriers.  The idea being that Fermions can transform into Bosons and back.  The problem is that nature has no observational evidence for supersymetry partners.  Another problem to some people is the added extra dimensions.  These again have no direct observational evidence in nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PRE-MODIFICATIION THEORY BASICS:  The original field theories of the Standard Model pictured particles as points in space-time.  There are two standard field theory models, which, while giving accurate data on the particles has several inherent problems.  The first of these is Quantum Chromodynamics.  This is the theory that describes the Strong Force carrier.  The second is Quantum Electrodynamics.  This deals with the combined electromagnetic and weak forces.  The problem with these theories is that not only have the two never been accurately combined, they exclude General Relativity from their fold.  At best they are incomplete.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>String Theory replaces the point particle with something that does not inscribe a point and as such avoids the singularity problem that normally generates infinities as an answer.  Also, instread of a long list of different particles one has particles as  manifestations of the same basic string vibrating in different modes.  String Theory is also the only theory where General Relativity cannot be combined with it.  In Fact, the  basic fundamental state of the string is the Spin-2 carrier of gravity, the Graviton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>THE THEORY:  As mentioned earlier, the theory starts with two space-time manifolds, the 2D space-time, which is smaller than the Plank scale by more than the 50th power, and a 6D Higgs space-time larger than the Plank scale by more than the 50th power in light years.  At first these two space-times were not united, but, since the 2D space-time was smaller than the Plank scale it had and infinite probability of undergoing a quantum phase shift.  This phase shift was what fractured its original 2D frame into a 4D framework.  As it expanded and fractured, the now 4D space-time was composed of negative energy.  Since the 6D Higgs space-time was composed of positive energy, it caused 6D space-time to contract.  This is the start of what cosmologists call the inflation period.  It actually was the inflation/deflation period!  What these two energy waves make is a tube within a tube that is at its basic element two waves looping at both ends into each other.  The outer tube is what we call a graviton.  The inner tube is its SUSY counterpart.  At the start, during the inflation period these two tubes were still separate.  But, by the end of inflation they had become welded together into one basic space-time manifold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other thing that transpired at the end of inflation was that space-time as a whole took on a unique nature.  Since the two subspaces are united their resultant will manifest aspects of each side.  The natural tendency for the set is to expand.  That expansion is only limited locally and globally by gravity.  But, since the 6D portion is larger than the 4D portion, the rate of expansion over time will eventually speed up.  This is in spite of the fact that gravity originally slowed expansion down.</p>
<p>This theory solves some basic String THeory problems.  It solves the problem with SUSY by having the counterparts hidden in 6D Higgs space-time.  It solves the problem of inflation by giving an actual means for that inflation.  It explains why 10 dimensions.  It establishes why the old always came up with either infinities or with negative answers.</p>
<p>But there is another thing this theory solves.  It explains why the coupling constants appear and what they stem from.  If you take the coupling constants for all the force carriers and add them together they give an answer from which the actual value of the mass density of the universe, OMEGA can be derived.  That value is 1.1800730144.  But, that is not all.  The 1 part becomes the value for the viewable combined space-time.  The .1800730144 becomes the value for the 4D graviton compotent.  Thus, it also explains why depending upon how you slice or look at the universe one gets different answers.  Recent observations have our portion to be flat, thus a 1.  But, some observation still tells us that more matter is present.</p>
