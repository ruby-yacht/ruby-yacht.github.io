  player 3 claims to have 2 queens<br>
  round 5:<br>
  player 1 has one king and resets the counter<br>
  player 2 claims to have one ace<br>
  player three claims to have two twos and is called by player 1, they were twos and player 1 picks up all 16 cards</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>the game continues from here with player 1 being able to play large amounts of cards, and no one calling out that they doubt it. There are a few skipped rounds ending with player 3 playing the ace of diamonds.</p>
